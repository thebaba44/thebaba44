### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tiger. I graduated with first-class honors in Electrical Engineering back in 2020 ðŸŽ“. However, I pivoted to front-end development because I have a strong desire to utilize my creative skills and bring entirely new ideas to life ðŸŒ±. 

I enjoy challenging myself and doing really hard things, which is why I chose to immerse myself in CSSâ€”a decision that initially felt masochistic ðŸ˜ˆ. After six months of dedicated effort, CSS and I became inseparable allies ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›!
